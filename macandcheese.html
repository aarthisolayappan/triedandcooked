        <div><span class="description"><span class="highlight">Mac and cheese</span> is easy instant food that never fails to comfort you. The creaminess of it just leaves you on cloud 9 (unless you're not a fan of the butter and cheese obviously). When you don't know what to cook or when you feeling like whipping something up for dinner in less than 15 minutes, this is what my mom always did. She'd make a pot full of <span class="highlight">Mac and cheese</span> for my sister and we'd take our own portions. We'd bring the pot to the TV room, eat and watch TV simultaneously. We wouldn't care if the pasta went cold because well, cold <span class="highlight"> Mac and cheese</span> has its own taste too.</span></div>

        <div class="title"><span class="enlarge">Memory highlights:</span></div>
        <div class="description" style="padding-top: 8px;">  I took this box of <span class="highlight"> Mac and cheese </span> when I moved for college and it used to sit in my cabinet for the longest time because you don't get it in India. We only got these boxes when we had people visit from the US; so as you can see, it was too precious. This box of pasta, however, is WAY too much for just one person so my friend and I would find the right time to eat the pasta. The first time we made it, it was absolute heaven. We put on the show Friends, took a fork each and dug straight into the pan and probably scraped it to the last bit. The second time, however, we made it without butter and well, you can guess how that went. There's no concept of leaving leftovers with <span class="highlight">Mac and cheese</span> (even if it has no butter). You either finish it or someone finishes it for you (you might as well stuff yourself and have a great nap than give it up, no?).</div>
