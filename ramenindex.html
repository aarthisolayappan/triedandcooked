          <div class="description">To be honest, I was getting bored of cooking my own food. So, I made plans with a friend to meet for dinner at a Korean place. Ever since I came to New York, I was waiting to have some nice Korean food because who doesn’t love their flavours? After a lot of research, I chose this place in Midtown (I think). It was a nice 30 minute walk to the restaurant at around 8 PM. We went up to the waiter and asked them what their restaurant was famous for and ordered both of it. It was the Soondubu Ramen with Pork and Egg and the Chicken Bulgogi with rice. As we saw it come over to the table we were just stunned by the quantity. It was a lot. Nevertheless, we were hungry so we did not complain. I didn’t know how either would exactly taste so I did not have any expectations. I was a fan of the ramen but the Bulgogi chicken was a tad bit sweet. However, the sides that it came with made up for it. Both of us were extremely hungry so we downed the food with absolutely no time to waste. The soup in the ramen was my absolute favourite. I was lucky enough to take home the leftovers and have it for lunch the next day.</div>

      <div class="container">
        <div class="title">Memory highlights:</div>
        <div class="description" style="padding-top: 8px;">  I remember taking about 15 minutes to decide between the 10 things that were there on the menu – even after he told us what they were famous for. I’m indecisive so it makes sense. I was satisfied that we didn’t make the wrong choice. The memory associated to this dinner was more of what happened after. We came for dinner relatively early so we could catch the drone show that was happening in Central Park. So, after that filling meal (and packing leftovers for home) we made our way to Central Park (which kinda looked more creepy in the dark). Luckily, we found the crowd and had 5 minutes to spare before it started. At 9 PM, a couple drones with a blue light lit up in the sky moving in a synchronised manner. It was a pretty sight that I couldn’t not capture on camera due to the garbage quality of my phone.  However, the show lasted only five minutes from where we were standing because the drones began to move across the park and behind the trees. We couldn’t really do anything so we just took a scroll across the park for a while and that was the end of it. It was a good walk back home too.</div>
